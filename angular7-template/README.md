## Template

This template was inspired by Angular best-practices mentioned in the [Pluralsight course by Jim Cooper](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=best-practices-angular&author=jim-cooper&name=099afa72-35ee-4f15-9f26-257b10c11665&clip=2&mode=live) and author's experience with front-end development.

The main goal of this template is to create a stable infrastructure and solid foundation for a long-term Angular projects. 
It proposes and showcases implementation of the following commonly used principles in front-end programming:

* Single Resposibility
* Dependency Injection
* Dependency Inversion
* Software Modularity & Lazy Loading
* Code Debugging
* Type Checking & Code Formatting shared across the development team

### Visual Studio Code

This template was created using Visual Studio Code that provides tools for:

* Refactoring (rename, search, replace, ..)
* Type-checking
* Syntax higlighting and autocomplete (IntelliSense)
* Integratated console

#### Extensions

Moreover it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code with following extensions to reach the best productivity.

1. [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) enables to set break point and watch variables while running an application.
2. [NPM](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script) validates dependencies defined in package.json.
3. [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) displays errors in TypeScript file formatting as you write a code.
4. [StyleLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shinnn.stylelint) displays errors in CSS/SCSS/Less file formatting as you write a code.
5. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) automatically fixes TSLint/StyleLint errors and formats code on document save. Formatting is based on project settings and has to be allowed in Visual Studio Code settings.
